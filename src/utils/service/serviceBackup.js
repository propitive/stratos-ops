    DevSecOps as a practice and culture has taken the IT world by storm. For
    eons, IT security, operational, and development teams have functioned
    independently leading to frequent clashes in objectives that ultimately
    delayed delivery timelines. A common scenario was software being newly
    deployed to run critical systems after repeated testing and iterations only
    to be blocked by a security filter predicting vulnerabilities in the
    codebase.
    <br />
    <br />
    This necessitated the rise of modernized application, software building,
    testing, and deployment environments that integrated security checks,
    frameworks, and tools at every step of the operational process. The
    modernized development environments are realized with CI/CD (Continuous
    Integration/Continuous Delivery) pipelines and security integration of the
    same drives the core of a firm’s DevSecOps model.
